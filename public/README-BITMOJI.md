To add your male bitmoji image to the About page:

1. Get your bitmoji from https://www.bitmoji.com
2. Download it as a PNG image
3. Save it in the `public` folder as `bitmoji-male.png`
4. The image should be at least 192x192 pixels for best quality

The component will automatically display your bitmoji on the About page hero section.
